# Ecosystem data visualizations gallery

Feel free to add your visualization efforts related to ecosystems used by the Southern Resident Killer Whales, and other marine soniferous species heard through the Orcasound hydrophones. Provide a summary through any combination of screenshots, links, and/or explanatory text. Add links to supporting scripts, notebooks, or other code in the associated directory -- [ecosystem-viz](https://github.com/orcasound/orcaviz/tree/main/ecosystem-viz)

## Raw audio data 
(HLS for all nodes; FLAC experimentally, intermittently)

## Human detections 
(labels from community scientists listening live via the Orcasound web app)

## Machine detections 
(un/moderated candidates within the OrcaHello real-time inference system)

## Bioacoustic bouts 
(see Google sheet of Orcasound annotation candidates some of which have been labled to various degrees as described in the orcadata wiki)

## Marine animal location data 
(presence and sometimes track data, inferred from sightings, hearings, etc) via the Acartia data cooperative
